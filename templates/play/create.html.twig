    <h2>Create A Character</h2>
    <p>Characters in Hauls of the Abyss can be one of many races and have one of many origins, each with their own upsides and downsides.</p>
    <p>For instance, humans are considered "average", while orcs are stronger but less agile, and goblins are more agile but can take fewer hits.</p>
    <p>Notice: You have {{ activeChars }} of {{ allowedChars }} allowed characters.</p>
