    <h1>Anonymous IP Blocked!</h1>

    <p>Hey, HotA Administration here, we've blocked you access attempt because we're not 100% certain you're a legitimate user.</p>

    <p>We respect that there are users out there who value their privacy as much as or more than we do, and trust us, we do.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, a few bad actors ruin it for everyone, and they use services like the one you're probably using to access HotA to get an unfair advantage in the game.</p>

    <p>So, we aren't allowing most traffic from any IP address I can't trace back to an actual user (basically, no VPNs or TOR).</p>

    <p>The key word there is most. If you really do believe you need to protect yourself to that degree just to play a browser game, you're welcome to reach out to us on Discord or via email to discuss it. Hauls of the Abyss, like other projects Andrew has worked on, has functionality to M&F to support allowing specific users to do just that.</p>
