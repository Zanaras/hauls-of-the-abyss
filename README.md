## Hauls of the Abyss
Created for the [PBBG Game Jame 2023](https://itch.io/jam/pbbg-game-jam-2023), Hauls of the Abyss (HotA) is a fantasy dungeon crawler designed for solo or team play in a persistent, online, browser-based world.

Almost every aspect of the dungeon itself, besides a few seed concepts, is intended to be generated locally to the game instance itself, with each "floor" of the dungeon being generated only when the floor(s) before it are accessed by the players. There is no end to the dungeon though, just an end to those brave enough to attempt venturing inside.

Thematically, it draws inspiration from a lot of places, some of which we'll eventually list here.
